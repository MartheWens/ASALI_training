    "## Introduction\n",
    "For this exercise, imagine you live in rural, semi-arid place in Kenya and have a household to run. You need <span style=\"color:red\">85.86 liters</span> of water per week per person for your household - domestic water demand. You want to implement a new water harvesting technique and want to know the effect of climate change on your investment. Therefore, you need to analyse if your investment is feasible. In order to analyse this, you have a water storage model (this script) and meteorological data (csv file) at your disposal. The water storage model is a simple model in which water can be harvested and stored during a period of time. The model runs on a daily time step basis in which water enters the system through direct precipitation or runoff and leaves the system through usage of water and evaporation. Two types of water harvesting structures (WHS) will be analysed in this practical; a cistern and an open pond. Dimensions and usage can be altered in the script. For cistern storage, the evaporation is assumed to be zero, however it is more expensive to build <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2015.02.019\">(Lasage & Verburg, 2015)</a>. The model takes input of a comma-separated meteorological data file in which data of the years, months, days, precipitation and temperature of the chosen region is found. The following paragraphs are a guide to the script.\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">During this practical we will focus on basic time series analysis and list operations in Python. While programming, you will come across errors in your script. Try first to read the errors and understand what went wrong. A lot of the times it’s just a typo. When you are in doubt about the error, it might help to google the error message and maybe add the function you used to narrow the searches down. A very helpful site that will pop up in google is stackoverflow in which similar problems are solved by the stackoverflow community.\n",
